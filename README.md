# VS Code Website - Clone

I was learning about front-end development, and made this project for practicing my HTML/CSS skills.
The image(s) and logo(s) were taken from the official <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS-Code</a> website.
I could not find the font they used on the official page - "Segoe UI", so i just used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat" target="_blank">Montserrat</a> font.

Here is the screenshot of the project :- <br>
